# Breast Cancer Detection using Deep Learning
This project focuses on developing a deep learning model to classify breast cancer as benign or malignant based on medical imaging data. It leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a powerful class of deep learning models, to analyze breast tissue images and predict the presence of cancer. The model is trained using a publicly available dataset of breast cancer images, and it achieves high accuracy in identifying benign and malignant tumors.

Features:
Data Preprocessing: The dataset is cleaned, resized, and normalized to improve the model's performance.
CNN Model: Utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network for image classification.
Evaluation: Model performance is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Visualization: Includes tools to visualize the modelâ€™s predictions and performance on the test dataset.
Technologies Used:
Python
TensorFlow / Keras
NumPy, Pandas
Matplotlib, Seaborn
